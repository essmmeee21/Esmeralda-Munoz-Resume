Greetings everyone, My name is Esmeralda Munoz and I am a political science major. I am planning on using my degree I hope of getting into law school and become a lawyer, specifically an immigration lawyer. I am studying at the University of California, Riverside for my undergraduate degree. UCR is an amazing school, providing me with a variety of resources, especially being a first-generation student coming from immigrant parents. I am planning on working on my degree, with internships and being a part of the Chicano Law Club committee. I am also a part of the First Generation Student Association and the Planned Parenthood Activism Club.  I am currently a first-year, so I am still learning about my major, and diving into different political science classes. I am more specifically in political science/ public server as I go want to become a public server in the near future. I advocate for many rights such as the LGBTQ+ community, Chicano rights, BLM, womenâ€™s rights, and immigration rights. I will continue, growing and learning more for these communities and spreading awareness to many. I will continue to advocate, but most importantly educate many about these rights for the communities. 
 I am also diving into community service, as I do plan to help low-income communities. As coming from a low-income family, I have seen and felt the struggle, especially in the education system. I plan to provide more resources for many low-income schools and also extend a variety of different programs, into our community is non-profit organizations. I have participated in non-profit organizations with Big Brothers Big Sisters and Girls Inc. I have seen the impact it had on many people, including myself and I want to bring these great resources to my community. As said previously, I am from a low-income community and I plan to help those in the community as well. I plan to speak to these different schools, advocate for the rights and be able to grow the variety of low-income communities, along with uniting the parents for the children to achieve the American dream. 
I plan on having a minor in music. I grew a love for music during high school, being involved in different music programs like Marching Band, Jazz Band, Orchestra, and Chamber Singers. I plan to enjoy my hobby and expand my knowledge more on music theory. Music theory is an interest of mine, and I plan to take advanced classes to further my knowledge. I will join the music department at my university, like the jazz band and concert band. I plan on joining outside symphonies to continue playing and advancing my skills by playing on my alto saxophone and the keyboard. As I said, I will do music as a minor, if in the near future I plan to switch career paths and teach much music. Music is a way in which many express themselves, whether it be singing or playing an instrument, it is one interest that is loved by many.
